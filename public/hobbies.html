        <hr />
            <p>I enjoy doing lots of things in my spare time. I am very sporty and also like to listen a play music. I have played football for a long time from the age of 10 till 27. It was then that i found my passion for American Football whilst attending university. I have played since 2017 as a defensive lineman and linebacker, and have coached for a local university team called the Warwick Wolves.</p>
            <p>Currently i play bass guitar in a metal band, performing covers of bands such as Killswitch Engage and Deftones. We are also currently writing our own music as well, so watch this space.</p>
